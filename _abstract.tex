This paper presents a general variational inequality formulation that unifies static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. From this formulation, we develop a modular and extensible software framework. The framework does not impose a traffic model, unlike existing dynamic traffic assignment software tools, which tend to favor simulation-based traffic models. Rather, our software framework serves as a platform to explore different static and dynamic models and traffic assignment solution algorithms. It currently supports three different traffic models: a static model, a cell-based model, and the Merchant-Nemhauser model. It also includes the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the Extra Projection method, and the method of successive averages to solve the traffic assignment problems. The performance of the software is demonstrated with numerical results.
