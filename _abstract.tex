This paper presented a general variational inequality formulation that unify static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. From this formulation, we developed a modular and extendable software framework. The framework does not impose a traffic model, unlike existing dynamic traffic assignment software tools, which tend to favor simulation-based traffic models. Rather our software framework serves as platform to try different static and dynamic models and traffic assignment solution algorithms. It currently supports three different traffic models: a static model, a cell-based model, and the Marchant-Nemhauser model. It also includes the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the Extra Projection method and the method of successive averages to solve the traffic assignment problems. The perfomance of the software is demonstrated with numerical results.
